## Ruby Basics & Enumerables

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here...
  def offer_rose(person)
  'person' => "young prince"
  puts "Would you take this rose in, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"(#person)
end


```ruby
# code here
```
def offer_rose(person)
'person' => "young prince"
 puts "Would you take this rose in, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"(#person)
end

### Question 2

Assume the following hash...

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

residents.delete(belle)
belle.push]guests: []

Using Ruby...
- Remove Belle from the town residents
- Add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here...

```ruby
# code her
residents.delete(belle)
belle.push]guests:[]
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names...

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` and string interpolation, `puts` the following text...

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here...

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
Friends.each do |i|
  puts "friends of Belle"
end
```

## Ruby OOP

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`. Each `Animal` should have...
- A `name` attribute
- A `greet` instance method
- The ability to "get" and "set" `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba".

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class. The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have...
- A `king` attribute which is a boolean
- If the instance's `name` is "Simba" make the `king` attribute `true`

Create a new lion instance with the name "Simba".

```ruby
# code here
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD)...
- Genie
- Lamp
- Person
- Pet

ERD is a entity-relationship diagram. An ERD initiates the Active Record models and processes their attributes.

Person is the parent
Pet would be the child associated with the Person
Genie is grandchild associated with the Person
Lamp is the great grandchild associated with the person
```
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use `people` and `wishes` models.

Your answer...

```

```

### Question 7

Consider a class `Person` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` and has the following schema...

```ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL
)
```

Write Ruby code that will create an instance of a person.

Your answer...

```ruby
module ActiveRecord
  class person
    # some stuff
    class << self
      def find(...)
        # blah
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Write Ruby code that will query for any person that is 15 years of age.

Your answer...

```ruby
Replace this with your answer
```

### Question 8

Write a route in Sinatra that will print "hello world" in the web browser at the following URL: `http://localhost:4567/oh_hello`

Your answer...


```ruby
require_relative "hello world"
```
